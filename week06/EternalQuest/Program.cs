Program: Lets the user set goals with points and the user can then follow up these goals and get points for completion and grow in level.

Added functionality: I have made it possible for the user to see what it entered as a goal in one line. I have added bronze, silver, gold and platinum
levels that the user can reach if it reaches a certain amount of points. I have therefore also set a limit on how many points the user can get for
each type of goal. I have now also added the possibility to repeat checklist goals, so that they can be completed again and the user can recieve the
points and bonus.
